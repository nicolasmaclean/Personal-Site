    tools_str: MIPS and MARS
    description: A partner (Nick Weldum) and I created a MIPS disassembler, in MIPS. The program would take an input text file of instructions in hexadecimal format and output a MIPS assembly file. We used a table to store opcode/funct codes and their corresponding string instructions to streamline the process of adding compatiblility for instructions. Our program supported 43 instructions, almost over triple the required 18.
