    <div class="about-text">
        <p>
            I am a <span class="blue-light"> Computer Science </span> and <span class="blue-light"> Arts/Technology (ATEC) </span> student at The University of Texas at Dallas. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have always had a fascination with the ability to create. It is a truly great ability to imagine something and implement it through software, model it digitally, or whatever other form something may take shape in. My passion has led me deeper into game development and web development through programming and spread into 3d modelling.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am proficent in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Jekyll (static website generator), and the Unity Game Engine with C#, but I am also reasonable capable with Python, C++, Java, and MIPS.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also have strong skills in 3D modeling with Maya/Blender and some experience with PhotoShop, Clip Studio Paint, and Substance Painter <br>
