This project began with the teapot. I modeled it in Maya, textured in Substance Painter, and rendered in Arnold for the Modeling and Texturing 1 class. Shortly after the class finsihed, I finished the scene with some teacups, a candle, table, and made some final renders. The work done after the class was primarily in Blender, but the texture maps for the candle and teacups were made in Substance Painter.
