This project began with the teapot. I modeled it in Maya, textured in Substance Painter, and rendered in Arnold for the Modeling and Texturing 1 class. Shortly after the class finsihed, I finished the scene with some teacups, a candle, table, and made some final renders. The work done after the class was primarily in Blender, but the texture maps for the candle and teacups were made in Substance Painter.

This assignment was truly a work of love. I spent 3 weeks working on this teapot: one for modeling, UVing, and texturing. By this point in the semester I was ready for my brief second part of summer break to begin, but I really pushed myself to finish strong. I worked my ass off all semester and I wanted a final product to show how much I had learned/improved. 

## Reflection

I've had experience modeling and animation with Blender prior to joining the ATEC program, so I definitely fought with Maya as I had to readjust to the shortcuts and such. Funny enough after spending a semester and a half in Maya, Blender became somewhat foreign to work in. I would try to hold alt as I use the mouse to navigate, like in Maya. Although, now I use either with relative ease.

As I wrote earlier, I modeled and UVed the teapot in Maya and the rest of the scene in Blender. It was really interesting how Blender outperforms Maya and the other way around. Blender's modifers were much more reliable than Maya's object history, but I felt Maya's UVing toolkit was a little bit stronger.
