I created this interesting piece for the Modeling and Texturing 1 class with Tim Lewis. It's from about the middle of the term, so we had some practice with hi-poly modeling but were still learning new techniques. The cruxes of the assignment were the front and back pieces featuring interconnected arches and loops.

## Technique Highlight

This assignment was great to practice and demonstrate the negative space modeling technique. This involved creating n-gons in the shape of the holes in the plate. The edges of each n-gon were extruded and scaled to create a mesh flow that loops around the n-gon. Then, the center of each loop (the n-gon) was deleted and the loops were connected.
