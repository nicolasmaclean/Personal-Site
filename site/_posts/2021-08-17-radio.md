I created this interesting piece for the Modeling and Texturing 1 class with Tim Lewis. It's from about the middle of the term, so we had some practice with hi-poly modeling but were still learning new techniques. The cruxes of the assignment were the front and back pieces featuring interconnected arches and loops.

This assignment was great to practice and demonstrate the negative space modeling technique. This involved creating n-gons in the shape of the holes in the plate. The edges of each n-gon were extruded and scaled to create a mesh flow that loops around the n-gon. Then, the center of each loop (the n-gon) was deleted and the loops were connected.
