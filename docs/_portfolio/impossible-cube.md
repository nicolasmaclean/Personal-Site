# Breakdown

I created this effect with the magic of compositing. Layers were utilzed to render multiple versions of the same scene and were mixed together using masks.

In a higher-level sense, I have 2 different animations: one of the ant and one of the ring. I used 5 layers to capture both of these animations and create layer masks to composite them.
