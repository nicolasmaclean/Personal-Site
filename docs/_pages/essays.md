The past decade has seen a significant change in the relationship between our culture and video games. Video games were previously thought by most as a past time, a mindless activity with no benefit. The explosion of indie games in the late 2000’s and early 2010’s includes what I think of as experiences. Games like Ape Out, Firewatch, and A Short Hike are some of my first experiences in gaming beyond clicking and shooting. They invoke emotion and feeling through ambience and other methods to make the player feel specific emotions throughout the game. 

Ape Out’s adaptive soundtrack creates a level of immersion between the player and game as you can feel the impact of the fighting. Firewatch’s banter between Henry (the player) and Delilah helps you invest emotional into the characters and beautiful environment, not just the plot of the story. A Short Hike’s cute, cartoony art style and relaxing soundtrack allow you to relax as you hike up a mountain.

I have grown emotionally as I experience games, and my analytical skills have grown stronger as I try to understand what these experiences make me feel and how they accomplish this. These experiences inspire me to not just create, but to share humanity through my work.

*Ape Out* is a jazzy, fast-paced beat ‘em up in which an ape (the player) attempts to escape from captivity. The player must kill enemies in their way or dodge attacks as they move through randomized maze-like levels. The minimalist art style and exciting jazz soundtrack contribute to the film like ambience similar to that of Saul Bass’s famous opening sequences in movies like *Anatomy of a Murder*.

The minimalist art style utilized shows only silhouettes of characters, objects, and the level itself. This creates an easily digestible visual language for the developers to effectively communicate with the player, while still appearing interesting. The player is highlighted as orange against grays or other desaturated colors; enemies are white; and blood a deep red. This use of high contrast colors prevents the player from becoming overwhelmed as they quickly progress through the levels or start the game for the first time.

The player will immediately notice how the soundtrack adapts to their every action. As a player throws an enemy into the wall, a cymbal crashes in synchronization. This creates a deep level of immersion into the abstract world of *Ape Out*. The sound effects for actions are not immediately tied to their realistic counterpart, but to its soundtrack. The player does not feel as though they are this gorilla. The player feels like a character or hero in a movie. They feel the sense of power or glory we associate with movies.

The use of world space UI adds to the film like quality of Ape Out. The player doesn’t see a health bar, they feel the impact of a bullet and see the pale orange blood trail left behind. As the player takes more damage, they see the small drops of blood become larger and larger till death or escape. Further, the credits, tutorial messages, and level information are laid on the ground of the world for the player to read as they walk over it. This directly pays homage to opening sequences from Saul Bass and from more recent movies like *Catch Me If You Can*. The players ability to recognize this, consciously or subconsciously, acts as a pillar of the film like ambience.

*Ape Out* utilizes a simple silhouette art style with a grainy texture, an adaptive soundtrack, and an immersive UI to make the player feel powerful and immersed in an interactive movie like experience.
