        <p>
            My fascination with the ability to create led me to game development, but the creation of experiences through gaming, animation, music, or any other medium have become a driving passion to study and explore further.

            I am proficent with the Unity Game Engine and C#; Python and PySide2; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and Jekyll (static website generator). I am also reasonably capable with C++ and Java.
