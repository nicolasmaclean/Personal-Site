            I am a <span class="text-highlight"> Computer Science </span> and <span class="text-highlight"> Arts/Technology (ATEC) </span> student at The University of Texas at Dallas. <br>

            My main interest has always been programming, but I have been developing skills and passion in modelling and other forms of digital art the past few years. I love each in their own regard, but there is nothing more interesting, to me, than the intersection of art and programming. This more generally accumulates itself as a fascination in procedural art and animation. <br>

            I am proficent with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the Unity Game Engine with C#, but I am also reasonable capable with Python, C++, Java, and MIPS. I also have experience with Photoshop, Substance Painter, and modelling in Blender/Maya. <br>
