            I have always had a fascination with the ability to create. It is a truly great ability to imagine something and implement it through software, model it digitally, or whatever other form something may take shape in. My passion has led me deeper into game development and web development through programming and spread into 3d modelling.<br>

            I am proficent with HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Jekyll and the Unity Game Engine with C#, but I am also reasonable capable with Python, C++, Java, and MIPS. I also have experience with Photoshop, Substance Painter, and modelling in Blender/Maya. <br>
